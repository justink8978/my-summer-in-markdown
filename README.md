# Justin Kim's Summer in Markdown
## 1. Summer Travel Experience
During the summer I went on a trip to Canada and New York with my family. We stopped in Montreal and explored Quebec for half of the trip visiting places and getting food. We then flew to New York and spent the rest of the trip there.
## 2. Favorite Summer Memory with Friends
My favorite summer memory with friends was going to the beach together. We took ubers to the beach and met up, got food, and explored the beach. We played football, beach volleyball, and took pictures.
## 3. Summer Playlist
Some music I enjoyed over the summer was Kanye and Frank Ocean. I also listened to a lot of A$AP Rocky and the new Clairo album 'Charm'. 
## 4. Future Aspirations
Some of my future aspirations are getting accepted to a target/dream college. I want to also pursure podiatric med-school and become a podiatrist after finishing college.
## 5. Learning Experiences
During the summer I took an online dual-enrollment class at Oxnard College. I took Sociology 101 and I eally enjoyed it. I think sociology as a subject was really interesting and I am glad I took the class.
